Hello, thanks for downloading this model. If you open the scene file in
maya and the scene objects are black, it is because the textures have broken
file links. To fix this problem just go into the hypershade menu and reload
the textures. If this doesn't work, go and source the texture address in the
texture file provided. Thanks again and be sure to rate this model on turbo
squid.

p.s: This model was made in Maya 2008 and may not open in older versions.
