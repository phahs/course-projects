Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Completed] Edit the enemy counting script 10h (8h)
  > Edited the counting script to count the individual enemies on the map 
  > including the boss. 
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Fix town portals 10h (6h)
  > Still have not figured out how to fix the town portals so they stop 
  > porting to two different locations. Cannot make it so they port back 
  > to where the player left the town map.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Fix the boss room 1h (1h)
  > Added box colliders to all the objects in the boss room so the bosses cannot 
  > shoot or melee between them.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Weekly player and map bug testing 10h (8h)
  > Fixed the boss room shooting between boxes glitch. Town portals are still bugging. 
  > Fixed door portal bugs that happened on entering the levels. Need to fix and 
  > resize the banana cannon commando and his camera so they all match again. Fixed 
  > devlog errors, and the header glitch that happened again after pushing and 
  > pulling process bugs it.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Artwork 16h (14h)
  > Finished the Banana Cannon Commando for all weapon attachments. Finished
  > Dr. Rotten. All character artwork is done!
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Misc. coding and bug fixing 2h (1h)
  > Ken found an issue with the Orple, where it wouldn't chase the player got
  > got far enough away. I took a look and found that the problem was with the
  > environment. The obstacles were not blocking the raycast that the Orple
  > uses to determine if the player is in line of sight, and as the Orple's
  > line of sight is almost as large as it's area of influence, it would not
  > chase the player. Simply added a box collider to the obstacles and the
  > Orple worked as intended.
  > Philip Hahs

=======================

Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Completed] Discuss and write up all the core goals for the week 3h (3h)
  > Discussed the key things both of us have to get done for the week that are 
  > vital to finishing the game by the deadline. Ken was scribe.
  > Ken Haney, Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Create map barriers and enemy counter script 20h (4h)
  > Added in barriers to block the player from entering a new zone until he has   
  > completed the level in the current town zone or level zone. Found a sample 
  > counter script. Need to edit it so that it will count the enemies and remove 
  > a barrier to the boss rooms when the player has killed a set number of enemies 
  > in the level zone. Still have to figure out to remove a barrier after the player 
  > has completed the current available level. This script will most likely not 
  > spawn the gun mod they can obtain before or after fighting the bosses.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Redesign the boss room and move the old one to supermarket level 10h (6h)
  > The orchard boss room was moved to the supermarket level for the machomato boss. 
  > The Orchard level has been made bigger and more open for the orple boss.  
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Add in and replace more objects and some enemy AI in the levels 18h (17h)
  > Did not create a do not enter sign that will direct the player to a secret place 
  > behind the buildings. Deciding to just have the boss drop it after death or have 
  > it placed in the boss room. Replaced some of the apple enemies in the orchard level 
  > with orange enemies, added tomatoes in the supermarket. Added in the bosses for 
  > the first two levels. Need to add them for the third level, but still having 
  > problems getting the first boss to move. Replaced the storage racks in the back 
  > of the supermarket level to reduce slight lag in the level. Did not change the 
  > microwave model to be bigger and act as either a torture device or a cage cell 
  > in the prison section of the castle level. I made my own prison cells instead. 
  > Raised the castle inner walls so the enemies cant fire through them. Moved the 
  > chairs around in the dining room of the castle level so they spin in funny 
  > directions and float above the room.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Improve town portals 8h (6h)
  > Edited the portal script, but I still cannot get the portals to save the 
  > player's position in the town. 
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Determine the hit points of enemy AI and player weapons 2h (2h)
  > Made a chart to organize and determine the hit point values of each enemy 
  > and the player weapons for damage receieved and damage given. Edited the 
  > enemy health script to fit the values.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Weekly player and map bug testing 10h (7h)
  > Fixed lag issues in second level. Still working on bug for portals to town. 
  > Need to fix the boss room so the boss cannot shoot through boxes.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Artwork 30h (23h)
  > Due to overestimation in my ability to finish assignments in my other
  > classes, I was not able to finish all of the Banana Cannon Commando. I have
  > two more angles to draw and need get the cannon drawn in the 8 different
  > angles. As the BCCom is not done I have also not started on Dr. Rotten.
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Miscellaneous coding 2h (1h)
  > The Orple code and the MachoMato code has been modified to reflect their
  > new  attack styles. The Orple has an extended range for being able to throw
  > projectiles, and will switch between both the orange projectile and the
  > apple projectile dependant on how close the player is to the Orple. The
  > MachoMato will now do a charging punch against the player, rather than
  > constantly chasing the player trying to punch him like the other tomatoes.
  > Player save state has been improved so that the attachment that is being
  > used when the player leaves a level is maintained on the loaded level.
  > Philip Hahs

2015-04-13
=======================

Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Completed] Add in new 3D objects to the maps 5h (8h)
  > Added in the new shelves for second level, and made apple babies for the 
  > trees in the first level. I made doors for the fruitopia town level, however, 
  > they were all deleted in the process of pushing and pulling. The only doors 
  > that are still up are in the castle level. I do not know how to get them back. 
  > I reskinned the castle map with the fruit image, skinned the throne, and 
  > skinned the shelves in supermarket.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Research and obtain more 3D models for maps 10h (10h)
  > Found more 3D models and textures to replace the object place holders for 
  > each of the levels. These new models include buildings, an eye ball, and 
  > orange cones that may be useful for blocking off areas of the town. Designed 
  > the basic models for the shelves. Designed basic hedges, bushes, and side 
  > walk paths for the park level.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Build the vegetable garden level into a park 10h (9h)
  > Added in objects for map design to change the garden level into a park 
  > that will now act as a treasure trove of ammo and health packs that will be 
  > guarded by either a small group of enemies and one previous boss or both 
  > bosses from the first two levels. It will depend largely on how difficult 
  > it is to beat two bosses at the same time. This place may still act as the 
  > main menu backround screen. The level polishing will probably be kept simple 
  > and open so I can focus on other levels more.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Research and implement improved level portals and warp portals 12h (10h)
  > Made a script that warped the player successfully from one spot to the 
  > other. The problem was that I could not get the player to warp through 
  > walls using the jump mechanic for the warp portals. Philip Hahs remade 
  > the script to work with the nav-mesh he created better so the warp portals 
  > work now. I can warp to and from the main orchard map to the boss room. I 
  > will have to implement this in the castle level. For the main town portals 
  > switching between levels, I have only got the pseudo code and construct down 
  > of how I want to implement the code so the player ends up where he was when 
  > he left the town map. 
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Weekly player and map bug testing 10h (7h)
  > Philip had problems running and shooting at the same down when moving 
  > up or down on his game. I did not have this problem, and believe it 
  > does not need to be fixed unless the problem continues on his machine. 
  > I have noticed that I cannot fire diagonally without holding down two 
  > directional buttons, otherwise it will switch back to non-diagonal 
  > direction shooting. I play tested Philip's villager movements, and found 
  > they move backwards too often and also collide with buildings and each 
  > other so that they occupy the same space. Philip has fixed the collision 
  > issues already. I lost all my doors in the town map that i placed on most 
  > of the houses due to pushing and pulling unkown errors. I will have to redo 
  > all the doors in the town map. I would like to figure out an alternative to 
  > fix my warp portals that will not port through static objects, but there is 
  > no time for that and it is working with Philip's nav-mesh method.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] NPC Character Art 30h (22h)
  > Finished the tomato, grape and watermelon sprite sheets. Started coding a 
  > way to change the sprites based on what direction they are moving.
  > Philip Hahs

This Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* Discuss and write up all the core goals for the week 3h
  > Discuss the key things both of us have to get done for the week that are 
  > vital to finishing the game by the deadline. Ken will be scribe.
  > Ken Haney, Philip Hahs

* Create map barriers and enemy counter script 20h
  > Add in barriers to block the player from entering a new zone until he has   
  > completed the level in the current town zone or level zone. Make a counter 
  > script that will remove a barrier to the boss rooms when the player has 
  > killed a set number of enemies in the level zone. This script should also 
  > remove a barrier after the player has completed the current available level. 
  > This script may also spawn the gun mod they can obtain before or after 
  > fighting the bosses.
  > Ken Haney

* Redesign the boss room and move the old one to supermarket level 10h
  > The current boss room in the orchard level will be prefabbed and moved to 
  > the supermarket level, because it's tight spaced zone is better suited for 
  > the machomato boss that we decided to have in the second level. The new boss 
  > room in the orchard will be made bigger and more open spaced for the long 
  > ranged attack from the orple boss that is a half orange half apple frombie. 
  > Ken Haney

* Add in and replace more objects and some enemy AI in the levels 18h
  > Create a do not enter sign that will direct the player to a secret place 
  > behind the buildings to what will most likely be the pellot gun mod. Replace 
  > some of the apple enemies in the orchard level with orange enemies and maybe 
  > one or two other enemies. Add in the bosses for the first two levels and 
  > maybe the third level. Consider replacing the storage racks in the back of 
  > the supermarket level to reduce slight lag in the level. Change the microwave 
  > model to be bigger and act as either a torture device or a cage cell in the 
  > prison section of the castle level. Raise the castle inner walls so the 
  > enemies cant fire through them. Move the chairs around in the dining room 
  > of the castle level so they spin in funny directions and float above the room.
  > Ken Haney

* Improve town portals 8h
  > Edit the portal script so the town portals will save the player's position 
  > when he enters and leaves a specific level so he pops out from the map he 
  > entered when he left that map.
  > Ken Haney

* Determine the hit points of enemy AI and player weapons 2h
  > Make a chart or two to organize and determine the hit point values of each 
  > enemy and the player weapons for damage receieved and damage given.
  > Ken Haney

* Weekly player and map bug testing 10h
  > Fix any issues in the levels that come up. Test for any new bugs, glitches, 
  > and any new problems.
  > Ken Haney

* Artwork 30h
  > Finish Banana Cannon Commando artwork. Start on Dr. Rotten's artwork.
  > Philip Hahs

* Miscellaneous coding 2h
  > Fix any small bugs that Ken finds, improve the player save states so that
  > when the player leaves a "level" they will load in at the entrance to the
  > level. Update bosses AI to reflect the combat changes we have decided
  > to make for them.
  > Philip Hahs

Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Completed] Plot out all the final goals 2h (1h)
  > Made a list of all the things I absolutely have to have done before 
  > the due date that include things like character spawns, and save states.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Research and obtain more 3D models for maps 20h (18h)
  > Found more 3D models to replace the object place holders for each of 
  > the levels. Designed some basic models to be replaced in the supermarket
  > and the castle level.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Player and map bug testing 20h (15h)
  > Fixed the lag in second level. Tested for any new bugs and problems. Did

  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Player Character Art 9h (2h)
  > I'm rather dissapointed here, as I did not set aside time to work
  > on this part over the week and weekend. I was more concerned with
  > completeing the basic NPC's and getting them working as far as
  > sprite switching is concerned. What I did take the time to do was
  > sketch the cannon that is apart of the BCCom.
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] NPC Character Art 9h (15h)
  > Finished the Orange and the Apple sprite sheets. I have started
  > the tomatoes sprite sheet, but it is only about a quarter done.
  > This took much longer than anticipated because I switched from
  > hand drawing the characters to using SketchBook Pro to draw the
  > sketches, and had some learning curve time in using that. Also,
  > I needed to take the sketches and create the sprites using
  > Inkscape, which also had a learning curve.
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Find Game Music 5h (1.25h)
  > Found a handful of compositions that have many different tones
  > spread through out each piece. The pieces that I have gathered
  > are: Toccatta and Fugue in D minor, Moonlight Sonata, Maple
  > Leaf Rag, and Night on Bald Mountain. The Maple Leaf Rag, as
  > it is upbeat and bouncy will likely be used for the main theme
  > of Fruitopia. Parts of Night on Bald Mountain will likely be
  > put into the Fruitcake Castle and the Orchard. The Toccatta
  > and the Moonlight Sonata will possibly be used in boss fights,
  > or spliced into other zones. I am not sure what to do for the
  > Philip Hahs

This Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* Add in new 3D objects to the maps 5h
  > Add in the new shelves for second level, apple babies for the trees in 
  > the first level, and make doors for the fruitopia town level. Also add 
  > in any other objects that would make the environment more detailed.
  > Ken Haney

* Research and obtain more 3D models for maps 10h
  > Find more 3D models and textures to replace the object place holders for 
  > each of the levels. Design more basic models to replace object as needed.

* Build the vegetable garden level into a park 10h
  > Add in objects for map design to change the garden level into a park that 
  > will act as the menu backround so I can focus on polishing the other levels.
  > Ken Haney

* Research and implement improved level portals and warp portals 12h
  > Find, draft, and edit script code for warp portls, and edit code for town   
  > portals so they pop the player out where he entered. Apply them to 
  > the maps for the boss zone in the orchard level and the castle level.
  > Ken Haney

* Weekly player and map bug testing 10h
  > Fix any issues in the levels that come up. Test for any new bugs, glitches, 
  > and problems.

2015-03-16
=======================

Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Ongoing] Create town portals for each level 10h (12h)
  > Connected each scene with a basic script to the main town level.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Tweak any map objects that were discussed 15h (16h)
  > Moved and tweaked all the enemy AI and buildings. NPCs did not 
  > need to be moved. Did not add in item pickups, because the player
  > I have not tested the ammo rate to kill all enemies so they may 
  > not be needed. Added more content to the final level such as a 
  > lab room. Resized all rooms in final level so they are not all 
  > the same size and feel more open spaced.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Set up the AI patrol pathing 12h (12h)
  > Inserted all the patrol nodes for each enemy in all the levels.
  > I chose to leave some of them standing still. Did not insert patrol 
  > nodes for NPCs to walk around in town, because of villagers town script.
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Player and map bug testing 10h (8h)
  > Tested for any bugs or glitches and fix the errors the player 
  > would encounter. Did not find any bugs to fix. 
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Code Debugging 10h (5h)
  > Fixed a damage bug where the aoe zone that is created by the
  > Egg Splode Mod would damage enemies that were outside of the
  > zones' collider. This was due to the the enemies having a
  > large Sphere Collider for player detection. Fixed the issue by
  > having the sphere do a check if the enemies Capsule Collider
  > and the zones' Sphere Collider intersect.
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Code Streamlineing 15h (3h)
  > Modified the Player Controller script so that the controls are
  > a bit simpler. The keys WASD now only control the direction
  > the player is facing and the arrow keys control the movement
  > of the player. Before both the way the player was facing and
  > the direction the player was moving was controlled by WASD.
  > Philip Hahs

This Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* Fix town portals 10h
  > The town portals were working and then I pulled the new scripts 
  > and I forgot to make a new build save in a separate folder. The 
  > last version I had was too old. I also need to modify the portals 
  > so they port the player when they move into the portal zone instead 
  > of pressing a button.
  > Ken Haney

* Edit Final level design 5h
  > Add more stuff to the final level. Reshape the rooms again so the 
  > hall is bigger. 
  > Ken Haney

* Player and map bug testing 10h
  > Test for any bugs or glitches and fix the errors the player 
  > would encounter. Fix all the bugs I found Monday.
  > Ken Haney

* Player Character Art 5h
  > Going to attempt to redesign the Banana Cannon Commando to be
  > more cartoonish and less realistic.
  > Philip Hahs

* NPC Character Art 7h
  > Going to attempt to redesign all of the NPCs to match the new
  > design of the Banana Cannon Commando.
  > Philip Hahs

* Create Game Music 13h
  > Going to write the themes for the five distinct levels. Will be
  > sharing how the themes go with Ken to find the right musical tone
  > for the levels he has built.
  > Philip Hahs

2015-03-09
=======================

Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Completed] Map basic 3D objects in all levels 20h (20h)
  > Finished the new town design so it is smaller but more open and 
  > spread out. Each level is set to side more off the path from the 
  > mini town districts. Placed basic enemy AI in each level except 
  > the The Vegetable Garden level, because they will most likely be 
  > generated randomly. Left open spaces in 2 levels for bosses that 
  > we would like to do. New AI will be added later and replaced as 
  > they are being built. Item pickups have not been placed in the map 
  > yet, because they will more likely be droppped from enemies. 
  > Ken Haney

* [Completed] Map level bug testing 10h (8h)
  > Tested for any bugs or glitches and fix the errors. Fix all the
  > bugs and glitches found the previous week.Tested all the corners
  > and map walls for the player to escape through. There have been no
  > complications with the invisible walls so far.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Code Debugging 10h (6h)
  > Fixed an AI bug where the enemy would get stuck moving into
  > attack range and moving toward the player. This was do to the
  > raycast swapping between the player character and another enemy
  > in the scene. This was fixed with all enemies ignoring raycast.
  > Fixed bug where when the player gets to close to the enemy, the
  > enemy would stop reacting. This was fixed by placing the 
  > CalculatePath fuction as an if statement with the SetPath function
  > inside of it.
  > Fixed bug that would not update the totals for player health and
  > ammo. This was due to placement of a GetComponent call.
  > Fixed bug that would not update the items available for drop off
  > of defeated enemies to reflect what weapon attachments the player
  > has picked up. This was due to placement of a GetComponent call.
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Code streamlineing 15h (10h)
  > Combined the 2 player scripts, PlayerCharacter and
  > PlayerMovement into a single script, PlayerController.
  > The PlayerController script controls all button presses
  > of the player.
  > Combined 2 of the enemy scripts, BasicEnemyCharacter and

Last Week's Objectives
-----------------------
* [Completed]Discuss the fundamental game design objectives. 6h (6h)
  > Discussed the basic game mechanics involved in the game. The game 
  > will be a third person shooter. The player will have to navigate 
  > through the map levels and shoot enemies. We also discussed adding 
  > puzzle elements like switches. The player will use various gun types 
  > to shoot the enemies.
  > Discussed the enemy types and main bosses. We will have 5 basic 
  > fruit zombie enemies called frombies. If we have time, we will 
  > implement scaled up versions of some of the enemies and give them 
  > more health, which will be mini bosses. The main bosses have not 
  > been thouroughly discussed yet. 
  > Discussed the weapons that will be used. We have decided on one 
  > gun that can be modded four different ways. The main gun is called 
  > the Herbi-Cannon. The three other weapon modes are called Pellot 
  > Nozzle, Shotgun Rain, and The Egg Bomb.
  > Discussed the artwork and backround scenery we want to implement 
  > in the game's world.
  > Discussed the item pickups like health packs and ammo. We decided 
  > on fertilizer health packs. There will be various ammo drops, but 
  > we have not decided if they spawn off enemies or not.
  > Discussed basic story and catch phrases to include in the game.
  > Ken Haney, Philip Hahs

* [Completed]Write the game's design document based on the Gamasutra article by Tim Ryan 10h (6h)
  > Introduced the basic game concept where you play as a banana cannon 
  > commando fighting fruit zombies created by a mad scientist Dr. Rotten.
  > Wrote up which design tools we will use to create the game including 
  > Unity 3D engine using C# and JS scripts, Paint, Inkscape, and maybe 
  > Photoshop. We have not decided what tool to use for music, however 
  > it will be light hearted and fit the atmosphere in the world.
  > Wrote a more in depth description of each level we will build. The  
  > main hub level is a town called "Fruitopia". The levels in order 
  > are called "The Orchard", "The Supermarket", "The Vegetable Garden", 
  > and "The Giant Fruitcake Castle". Each level will be designed fairly 
  > unique from each other in background and scenary. Listed the key 
  > features that will be the core of the game in the design document.
  > Listed the game's genre and platforms the game will run on in the 
  > design document.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing]Building the world. 16h (7h)
  > Designed 2D map layouts for multiple levels on paper and some on 
  > paint program.
  > Started implementing basic background objects in the first level.
  > Ken Haney

* [Ongoing] Player character art. 12h (9.5h)
  > Sketched the body and legs/pants of the BCCom after realizing that
  > sketching the entire character would make some things more difficult.
  > Did not move on to sketching the arms or face. Once all of the pieces
  > have been made I will be putting them together as a single image.
  > Have 8 angles on the body and legs/pants.
  > Decided on the basic animations needed for the BCCom.
  > Failed on collaboration to determine more specific animations.
  > Philip Hahs

* [Ongoing] Friendly NPC character art. 20h (3h)
  > Sketched the body of all of the friendly NPC's. I realized that 4 angles 
  > was pointless as most fruit are mostly symmetrical and all that   
  > really mattered for perspective was the arms, legs and face placement.
  > Realized that I only needed one set of arms, legs, and faces in order to 
  > create all of the NPC's as the NPC's can share these "features".
  > Philip Hahs

* [Completed] Design player character abilities. 4h (2h)
  > Listed the actions the character can take in BCC_DD text file.
  > Colaborated with "Player character art".
  > Ken Haney


This Week's Objectives
